# VScode-ESling-Prettier
ESLint is a tool used for identifying bugs and errors in your typescript/javascript code to make code more consistent and easy to read. It is also known as linters. ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed.     Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
